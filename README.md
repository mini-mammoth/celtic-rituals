# Celtic Rituals

This mod aims to add a bunch of celtic rituals to Minecraft.

## Core Mechanics
 
Sacrifice mobs to please the gods and become a strong druid. 
In exchange the gods provide you with rewards like **rich harvest** 
or **improved condition**. 


Some rituals require special settings like location or weather, but also
some druid experience. 
Unfortunately, the ancient knowledge about all rituals got lost.
Thus, you have to discover those yourself. -
*These conditions are set at world generation* 

Be careful. Once you got the attention of the gods they are not always your friends.
