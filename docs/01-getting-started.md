# Getting started

Hearts are vital part of only many recipes. 
Yet they are not so easy to get as you need a **heart-breaking** weapon.

To get you first **heart-breaking** weapon, craft a **Druid Knife**.

Now run a round and find a **chicken** to become your first sacrificial. 
As soon as it touches the blood of the dead chicken, 
your knife releases its inner magic (_Heart Breaking III_).

Your knife is not yet very strong, 
but it has a **60%** chance obtaining a monsters heart, 
whenever you directly kill it.
Affront the dangers of the night 
and carve a heart out of a **Zombie**, **Creeper**, **Spider**, 
**Skeleton** and **Enderman**.

Now you have all ingredients to perform the **Heart Breaking Ritual**.
These ritual adds a _Heart Breaking I_ enchantment on any weapon.

Craft a **Ritual Bowl** place it outdoor and put all the five hearts in it.
When you are ready, ignite it with **Flint & Steal**. 
As soon as the fire burns, hurry up and put your melee weapon on top. 
As the fire extinguishes you can pick your weapon and kill monsters.
